                            <p>A brand's personality and identity are connected on a deep level. The personality
                                includes
                                human

                                the
                                brand's identity includes the image and message conveyed, as well as the communicated
                                visuals
                                like logos, colors, and fonts. The key to sending the right message about the brand and
                                the
                                first step toward creating an emotional connection with the audience is to make sure the
                                brand
                                personality, colors, and typography all support each other, make sense, and tell a clear
                                story.
                                Before building the brand personality profile, I developed a couple of target audience
                                profiles
                                for an effective assessment by considering the product and service offerings, and the

                                most interested in those offerings.

                        <p>Composing a mission statement took some exploring of what exactly The Whole Bean does,
                            understanding
                            the target audience, the reason for the service provided and how to best serve, the purpose
                            for
                            being in the industry, why the business was started, and the desired brand image to convey.
                            From
                            these details the brand purpose was summarized into a simple mission statement: <em>“To
                                nourish
                                and
                                inspire the body and mind.”</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>The creative brief helped to organize the scope of the project and also acted as a planning
                            tool
                            by
                            describing the goals and purpose, outlining the audience, budget, expectations surrounding
                            deadlines, and to clarify details prior to project work. It included the overall project
                            scope,
                            specific goals and objectives, general client and target audience information, look and
                            feel,
                            strategy, deliverables, and other important details.

                            <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
                            <p>Reviewing general color guidelines and how to stay in touch with audience
                                expectations, I chose to incorporate green into the color scheme with the dark
                                chocolate brown and neutral browns to accent. Green is
                                associated with: peaceful, growth, and health. The deep earth browns complement this and
                                add
                                coffee shop vibes.

                            <p>The selected typeface and font family traits to represent the brand need to match the

                                edges, modern style, and stability, that works with an interesting display font that

                        <h4>Logo & Icon Design</h4>
                        <p>An effective logo needs to blend seamlessly into a holistic identity system. Features of
                            effective logos include simplicity, being memorable, and versatility across platforms. A
                            logo
                            should capture attention, engage the audience, and even create customer loyalty.
                        </p>
                        <p>I began design of the logo by brainstorming keywords for the brand personality, grouping
                            them
                            into categories, viewing representative images, and then hand drawing some rough
                            sketches
                            for
                            the logo concept. Finally, I cleaned up my logo sketches into some final variations to
                            begin digital logo design.
