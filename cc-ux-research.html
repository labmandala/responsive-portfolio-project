                            customers to enjoy the experience of bike riding, reduce their carbon footprint by
                            biking
                            instead of
                            driving for travel, and it provides convenience to explore the downtown area.

                            call in or come by the shop in-person to book their reservations. Unfortunately, this
                            has
                            created a high number of phone calls and drop-ins, making it difficult for City Cycles

                            to
                            book bike rentals.

                            <p>I was able to overcome these challenges by using the defined problem statement as a basis
                                for
                                brainstorming solutions, by empathizing with the user, inductive and deductive
                                reasoning,
                                interpreting data, and design thinking methodology.

                        <h4><strong>Design Thinking</strong></h4>
                        <p>Through structured brainstorming I
                            experimented
                            with different methods for design ideation. I explored divergent thinking to generate
                            ideas
                            and
                            solutions through rough sketches using the Matrix Method, focusing on specific subsets
                            of
                            the
                            problem, then mashing up the matrix ideas to create new concepts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Then I switched to convergent thinking to find patterns and
                            similarities among the ideas gathered, grouped the ideas based upon those trends, and 
                            refined my main focus. Based on the gathered user data, I assessed what
                            needed to
                            change, what could be implemented, and prioritize those needs accordingly.

                <h3>Results & Key Findings</h3>
                <p>After performing research, collecting data, reviewing it for context, and analyzing the results,
                    I found
                    that users are frustrated with the City Cycles online reservation process and they are confused
                    trying
                    to navigate the site in general, witch they said was unclear. Two customers stated they always
                    call to
                    reserve because it’s the only real way to know they have a reservation, and another user said
                    they felt
                    misled. The data showed that users were relying heavily on the search bar to navigate rather
                    than
                    primary site navigation and the link to the phone number was the link with the highest traffic.
                    Users
                    overwhelmingly prefer to call in or drop by the shop, rather than struggle trying to figure out
                    the
                    reservation feature on the website.

                        <!--    <h4>Interpreting data</h4> -->
                        <p>City Cycles website analytics showed a consistent decrease in online bike rentals over
                            the year, and revealed that 85% of users were immediately leaving the site after
                            clicking the reservation link - a much higher rate than any other page on the
                            site.
                            Site users expressed annoyance when their default email unexpectedly
                            opened
                            up
                            for a back and forth email reservation process, and closed out of it to instead call the
                            shop.

                <h3>Takeaways & Discoveries</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>One of the most interesting takeaways from the City Cycles UX research process was that most
                        users visiting the site are unique, first-time visitors. Data shows 74.2% are new site
                        visitors,
                        while 25.8% are returning visitors. Since most of them never return to the site after the
                        first
                        visit, a negative experience may be preventing them from returning and may be a contributing
                        factor to City Cycles declining online reservations, and even losing potential customers to
                        competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>The existing frequent users want a recurring bike reservation feature on the site so that
                        they
                        can
                        reserve bikes for more than one day, and the convenience to keep them overnight so they
                        wouldn’t
                        have to go through the reservation process every day. They also want the ability to set up
                        reservations online in advance and manage them that way.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most of City Cycles users prefer bicycling because they enjoy the outdoors and are interested
                        in
                        exploring the downtown area, they dislike traffic-congested commutes and road construction
                        delays,
                        and want to reduce their carbon footprint and consider biking to be a more eco-friendly way
                        to
                        travel or commute.

                <h3>UX Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Based on the UX research data, I recommend that City Cycles modify their homepage, including the
                    navigation menu and reservation button, to clarify their message and purpose for users visiting
                    their
                    site. The reservation process needs to be improved so that it’s easier to use and more
                    efficient,
                    offering users a positive experience, so they will opt to reserve online instead of calling in,
                    and
                    will
                    even want to return as a customer. The online feature should offer convenience for the customer
                    to
                    obtain a bike rental.
